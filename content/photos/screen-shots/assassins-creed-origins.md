title: Assassin’s Creed Origins
description: Another return, to a series I hadn’t played since Assassin’s Creed III, but the setting of this one drew me back in. The AC games have always had a focus on making their open-world environments look incredible and this one is no exception, especially with dynamic day-night cycles and weather.

An expansion for the game takes you to some afterlife locations which makes for some pretty wild landscapes.
