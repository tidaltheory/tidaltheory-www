It eschews much of the city and civilisation environments of previous games but the different regions have their distinct look and atmosphere. Often, I would catch myself wandering around an area marvelling at the landscape, particularly the Ireland and France regions.

I haven’t played any of the recent expansions — I may return to it at some point but the main game is so huge I needed a break for a while.
