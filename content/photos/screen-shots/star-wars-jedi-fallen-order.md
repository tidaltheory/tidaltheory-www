Close-up portraits didnâ€™t work so well in this game due to lower-resolution textures and a lack of variety in facial expressions. Luckily, the photo mode allows a lot of distance of camera movement which meant I could capture the scale one of my favourite aspects of the Star Wars universe: huge scale, often ancient, technological constructions.

I also had a lot of fun capturing action scenes. It helps that the combat is very fluid and expressive, and that the main weapon is also a light&nbsp;source!
