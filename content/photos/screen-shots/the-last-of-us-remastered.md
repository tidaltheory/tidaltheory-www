This was my return to video games after not really playing anything for a few years. What a revelation — in terms of gameplay and story, but also my realisation that <span class="pull-double"></span><span class="push-double">“</span>photo mode” was a thing in games now. I was caught up in landscapes mostly, but started incorporating the characters more as I got used to it.
