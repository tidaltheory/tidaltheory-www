This was another game I didn’t spend a lot of time in photo mode in my initial run, in order to reduce the chance of spoilers. I’m currently working through a New Game+ run. I’m anticipating the Burning Shores expansion will have some new outfits based on the Quen tribe’s style so I’m collecting the matching facepaints.

I try to throw a few portrait-orientation shots in to mix things up, but I find
there’s a weird bug where recomposing is difficult after adjusting the rotation. Not sure if I’m the only one seeing this, but I hope it gets a&nbsp;fix!
