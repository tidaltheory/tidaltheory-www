description: Returning to video games after not really playing anything for a few years with this game I’d heard about since it’s initial release on PlayStation 3 was a revelation — in terms of gameplay and story, but also my realisation that “photo mode” was a thing in games now.

The game’s level of detail, both in environments and in characters, makes for a really rewarding photo mode. I was caught up in landscapes mostly, but started incorporating the characters more as I got used to it.
